Hey! Hypothetical reader!

Welcome to the blog! I'm not sure exactly what I'm going to use it for, but likely it'll be about whatever I'm interested in at the time.
At the moment, that means tabletop RPGs. Reading them, playing them, hopefully even writing them.
There could be some software development stuff. Or (very amateur) game development. Who knows.
Maybe this ends up being the only post.

That'll do for a first post. Cheers
