## Intro

---

## Principles

 * fiction over mechanics.
 * prefer words to numbers.

---

## Characters
Characters have three **Attributes**: **Strength**, **Dexterity** and **Charisma**.

Attributes can be *low* or *high*. Roll 2d6 for each attribute, and on a 10+ mark the attribute as *high*. On a 4-, mark the attribute as *low*.

Characters have a **Trait** and a **Background**.

Characters can also have a **Special Ability**, which is decided together with the GM.

---

## Procedures

When the outcome of an action is uncertain, or you're trying to avoid some danger, set the stakes with the GM according to the established fiction. 
Then make a D6 roll. On a 4+ you succeed and you get what you wanted. Otherwise, you face the agreed consequences.

If you can apply either clever planning, a *high* **Attribute**, **Trait** or aspect of your **Background** to the situation, succeed on a 3+ or modify the agreed stakes. If you have multiple advantages in the situation, don't bother rolling! 

Similarly, if you are at some disadvantage (e.g. from a *low* **Attribute**), succeed on a 5+, or modify the agreed stakes.

# Fighting, Wounds and Armour
You can take up to three minor wounds, and two major wounds before you are unable to continue adventuring. Once you have received three minor wounds, any further minor wounds count as major wounds. Wounds are inflicted based on what makes sense in the fiction. Armour can help either reduce the severity or even entirely negate wounds depending on the armour type and weapon type.

# Dungeon Crawling
  * A dungeon turn is approximately 10 minutes of in game time.
  * Appoint a Caller.
  * Appoint a Mapper.



# Inventory and Encumberance

You have 8 slots which can each carry a single item. 

Items can take 2 slots, if they're particularly large or cumbersome.

If you attempt to carry more, you are overencumbered and at a disadvantage when attempting athletic feats or defending yourself from danger.
